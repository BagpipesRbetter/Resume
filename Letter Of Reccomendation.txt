December 19, 2024, Art was Evanâ€™s mentor

It has been my privilege to mentor Evan Barclay as my IT Support intern at American Fork High School during the fall semester of 2024. 
Evan has been responsible, reliable, and quick to learn new responsibilities. I was easily able to turn over to him various tasks, such as: Chromebook maintenance and repair, PC and Mac imaging, device inventory reporting, and help ticket processing. 
I wish I could have had his services more than once or twice a week since he so effectively helped with our heavy IT Support workload. 
I can recommend Evan as a good worker, self starter, pleasant person, and as someone with great technical aptitude. 

Best regards, 
Art Allen
